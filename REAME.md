# ITP EXERCISES

This repository contains my solutions for ITP exercises. ITP stands for "Introduction to Programming Techniques" and in this course, I work on various coding assignments using the C programming language.

Every week, I am tasked with solving exercises related to a specific topic. These solutions are then tested by an online judge, and the [Plataforma LOP](https://lop.natalnet.br/) is utilized for this purpose.
